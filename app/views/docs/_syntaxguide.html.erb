    <h2>Quick Syntax Guide</h2>

    <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
    <p>Insert a blank line between blocks of text to create paragraphs.</p>

    <h3>Headings</h3>
    <p>Use one or more # characters at the start of a line to create headings.
    The number of # characters determines the heading level.</p>

    <h3>Emphasis</h3>
    <p>Surround text in *asterisks* to create <em>emphasised text</em>, and
    **double asterisks** to create <strong>strongly emphasised
      text</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Block Quotes</h3>
    <p>Put a &gt; character at the start of a paragraph to mark that paragraph
    as a block quote.</p>

    <h3>Dashes and Lines</h3>
    <p>One or more - (hyphen) characters only on a line surrounded by blank
    lines creates a horizontal rule: <hr></p>
    <p>If the <em>Smart Dashes</em> option is enabled:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>-- creates an <em>en dash</em>: &ndash;</li>
      <li>--- creates an <em>em dash</em>: &mdash;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lists</h3>
    <p>Unordered lists are created by putting a * or a - at the start of each item. The list must have a blank line above and below it:</p>
    <p class="syntax-literal">* Eggs
* Bacon
* Ham</p>

    <p>Numbered lists are created by putting <kbd>1.</kbd> before the first
    item; subsequent items can either have correct numbers, or you can just put
    <kbd>1.</kbd> before each one:</p>
    <p class="syntax-literal">1. Collect underpants
2. ?
3. Profit</p>

    <p>To include more than one paragraph in a list item above it, indent it by 4 spaces.</p>

    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>There are two parts to inserting an image, the <em>insertion</em> and
    the <em>reference</em>. The <em>insertion</em> is placed in the document
    where you want the image to appear, and looks like this:</p>
    <p class="syntax-literal">![image alt text][<em>ref1</em>]</p>
    <p>The <em>reference</em> is placed later in the document surrounded by
    blank lines (or other reference lines), and looks like this:</p>
    <p class="syntax-literal">[<em>ref1</em>]: http://www.example.com/filename.jpg</p>
    <p>To centre the image horizontally, and prevent text from wrapping either
    side of it, use two !  characters for the <em>insertion</em> instead of
    one.</p>

    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>There are three ways to insert links. The first is <em>inline</em>, and
    looks like this:</p>
    <p class="syntax-literal">[link text](http://www.example.com/)</p>

    <p>The second is by <em>reference</em>, and works similarly to images:</p>
    <p class="syntax-literal">Here is [a link to a different page][<em>ref2</em>].

[<em>ref2</em>]: http://www.example.com/</p>

    <p>Finally, if the link text is short, you can just use it as the reference
    itself:</p>
    <p class="syntax-literal">This paragraph contains a [<em>link</em>] to another page.

[<em>link</em>]: http://www.example.com/</p>

    <h3>Code</h3>
    <p>Code blocks can be inserted in two ways. The first is <em>inline</em>,
    where you just surround the code text with `<kbd>backticks</kbd>`. The
    second way is for larger blocks of code and is done by indenting your code
    by at least 4 spaces (or one tab):</p>
    <p class="syntax-literal"><span class="spaces">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</span>var paras = document.querySelectorAll("p"), l, i;
<span class="spaces">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</span>for (i = 0, l = paras.length; i &lt; l; i += 1) {
<span class="spaces">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</span>paras[i].style.color = "rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.7)";
<span class="spaces">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</span>}</p>
  </div>
