	<h1>Soda</h1>

	<p class="first">Soda is a simple online document application that allows
	you to create text documents in styles-based manner.</p>

	<p>Most document editors approach this from a character-level direction:
	you select some text, then apply a font, size etc. to it. While this is
	generally fine for short documents, for longer ones it quickly becomes
	unwieldy as you attempt to maintain consistency throughout.</p>

	<p>Soda is different: rather than mark selections of text with a font, you
	apply <em>styles</em> to text blocks, such as paragraphs or headings, using
	<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. The
	styles are defined for the whole document, creating a consistent look.</p>

	Note: at present only <%= link_to "registered", new_user_registration_path %> users
	are able to create and save documents. This will not always be the case.</p>

	<p>Once registered, click the 'Your saved documents' link at the top to get
	started.</p>
