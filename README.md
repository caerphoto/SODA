# Soda

## Introduction

Soda is an online document editor that lets you create simple documents using [Markdown]-formatted input. The default styles for headings, paragraph text etc. have been set up to minimise 'setup' time &ndash; just start typing.

The application is of course not finished yet, but the basic interface is ready to use, and can actually be quite handy for typing blog posts etc. (although it'll be easier once I add an 'HTML view' option)

## Still To Do

Login will be via third-party authentication (i.e. Facebook, Twitter et al), although there will still be the option to create an account using an e-mail address and password.

I also need to add a (proper) interface for modifying document styles.
