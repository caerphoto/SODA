Introduction
------------

Soda is an online document editor that lets you create simple documents using
[Markdown]-formatted input. The default styles for headings, paragraph text
etc. have been set up to minimise 'setup' time &ndash; just start typing.

The application is of course not finished yet, but the basic interface is ready
to use, and can actually be quite handy for typing blog posts etc. (although
it'll be easier once I add an 'HTML view' option)

Still To Do
-----------

The most obvious feature is the ability to save documents, and I aim to allow
this both for registered and unregistered users. The main advantages to
registering will be the ability to create private documents, and to change the
default styles for new documents.

Login will be via third-party authentication (i.e. Facebook, Twitter et al),
although there will still be the option to create an account using an e-mail
address and password.
